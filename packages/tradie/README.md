> The documentation for `tradie` is still a little rough. Please [ask questions and raise bugs on Github](https://github.com/jameslnewell/tradie-v4/issues). PRs are welcome!

A framework for building build tools like `create-react-app` tailored to your projects and tech stack.

#### Why?

Maintaining build tooling across similar projects is tedious and error prone! Moving the build tooling into a centralised package installable via `npm` makes it much easier to maintain, improve and upgrade across each of your projects.

Keeping the build tooling consistent across similar projects makes your team more efficent and allows them to onboard new team members more easily.

## Usage

`tradie` requires a template in order to know how to build, serve and test your app. 
Choose a [`template`](https://github.com/jameslnewell/tradie-v4/tree/master/packages/tradie#templates) and follow its documentation to set up up your project.
