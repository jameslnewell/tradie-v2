# @tradie/component-scripts

An opinionated set of scripts for creating and maintaining react components.

Feel like you spend more time setting up and updating the tools to build, test
and maintain your component? `@tradie/react-component-scripts` lets you focus on
writing code and spend less time setting up and updating the tools to build,
test and maintain your component. It provides you with a way to keep tooling
consistent across multiple components with minimal effort.

## Usage

Create a new folder for your project:

```
mkdir my-package && cd my-package
```

Create the files for your project:

```
npx --package @tradie/react-component-scripts tradie create
```

## Files

```
  coverage/
  example/
  dist/
  src/
  test/
  .flowconfig
  .gitignore
  package.json
```

### `coverage/`

This folder contains the coverage report generated by `tradie test --coverage`.
This folder should be added to your `.gitignore` file. This folder is removed by
`tradie clean`.

### `example/`

This folder contains scripts that demonstrate the functionality of your package.
These scripts can be run using the `tradie example <module>` command.

### `dist/`

This folder contains the transpiled sources generated by `tradie build`. This
folder should be added to your `.gitignore` file. This folder is removed by
`tradie clean`.

### `src/`

This folder contains the source code and the unit tests for your package.

### `test/`

This folder contains other tests e.g. integration etc

### `.flowconfig`

This file contains your config for `flowtype`. Typings are optional.

### `.gitignore`

This file excludes files from your version control system. It should at least
exclude the generated files and folders. For example:

```
dist
coverage
node_modules
```

### `package.json`

This is your package manifest. You should specify your package's main script and
which files will should be included in the package.

```json
{
  "main": "dist/cjs/index.js",
  "jsnext:main": "dist/esm/index.js",
  "files": ["dist", ".flowconfig"]
}
```

## Commands

### `tradie clean`

Remove generated files and folders.

```
tradie clean
```

### `tradie lint`

Lint sources, tests and examples.

```
tradie lint [--watch]
```

> This command doesn't enforce any stylistic rules. Use `prettier` instead.

### `tradie build`

Transpile sources and export their types.

```
tradie build [--watch]
```

### `tradie test`

Run tests.

```
tradie test [--watch] [--coverage]

## FAQ\*

> \*Questions that I think will be frequently asked.

### Can I use the latest language features?

Yes. The following Babel `presets` and `plugins` are configured:

* `babel-preset-env`
* `babel-preset-react`
* `babel-plugin-transform-class-properties`
* `babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread`
* `babel-plugin-transform-dynamic-import-node`

### Can I use types?

Yes! Create a `.flowconfig` and add `// @flow` comments to the top of your
files. Type information will be exported to `./dist`.

You should ignore the `./dist` directory. For example:

`.flowconfig`:

```ini
[ignore]
<PROJECT_ROOT>/dist
```
